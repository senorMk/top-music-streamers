            We recognize that Next.js and TypeScript don't solve every problem.
            While we encourage you to use the primitives they provide as often
            as you can, there are other tools that will help simplify and
            improve your developer experience.

            it is not Bootstrap. It enables a "flow state" in UI dev I didn't

          <p>
            This little library handles all your async React needs from data
            fetching to IO management. Hard to imagine doing React dev without
            it now. Might be able to replace your state management library too.

          <p>
            Prisma is to SQL what TypeScript is to JS. Never thought I'd love an

            tRPC delivers on GraphQL's promise of seamless client development
            against a typesafe server without all of the boilerplate. It's a
            clever abuse of TypeScript that provides an incredible dev
            experience.

            Man this library makes auth easy. No ownership compromise, hooks up

            use it.

            Vercel took the hell of web deployments and made it a set-and-forget

          <p>
            PlanetScale is the best "serverless database platform" I've used by
            far. Insane scale, great developer experience, fantastic pricing. If
            you're using sql (and hopefully Prisma), this is hard to beat.
